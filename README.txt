ON TILT

supported controls:
keyboard: arrow keys
DS4 controller: right analog stick
	note that the controller needs to be connected to the computer before opening unity or launching a built version of the game

how to play:
tilt the disk to funnel balls into either of the two holes within the time limit.
avoid red balls, they decrease your remaining time.
getting a chain of the same colored balls will start a combo, which increases the points earned and will add time to your limit.
get that high score.
